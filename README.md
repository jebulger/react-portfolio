# My React Portfolio

## Description
After learning how to work with React, the next step was to create my first React application. Looking back at my old portfolio, it was very clear that there were many ways I could improve upon it. Especially since that portfolio was my second time creating an application in general. Instead of reworking it, I decided it was the perfect time to recreate my portfolio, as there is so much more I understand about coding now. This project is my first front-end portfolio app created using React, and a big improvement on my original portfolio.
